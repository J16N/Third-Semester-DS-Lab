Algorithm for Program 3:
Step 1: Initialize a character stack named st
Step 2: Enter the string
Step 3: Traverse Through the expression running a loop from 0 to (length of string -1)
Step 4: If we encounter a opening bracket (,[,{
Step 4.1: push it inside the stack
Step 5: if u encounter a number or operator ignore it
Step 6: If the current character is a closing bracket (‘)’ or ‘}’ or ‘]’) then pop from stack and if the popped character is the matching starting bracket, then fine else brackets are not balanced.
Step 7: if the stack is empty after complete traversal then the expression is balanced
